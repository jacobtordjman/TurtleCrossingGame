This is one of my first projects!

Turtle Crossing game, who is not familiar with the concept of this game?
a very old and popular game for reference is Frogger which is of the same concept, try not to get squashed by passing cars

Well I tried to replicate that using only Turtle module in python.
Hope you will enjoy!!!
