## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move the turtle:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right

Avoid the moving cars and reach the top of the screen to win. Each time you successfully cross the road, your score increases by one. The game speeds up with each level, making it progressively more challenging.
